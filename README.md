# MAMClient

[![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-63419605-4/MAMClient/README)](https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon)

This is one of my first iterations into making a headless, packet based client/bot framework for Monster & Me 2.5. This code should compile and work on 32bit GNU/Linux and OS X systems.

The packet encryption may be somewhat buggy in this version. I believe I found out at one point I wasn't rotating the bytes enough.. Or something. Check the Java version to compare, that version is known to correctly encrypt/decrypt packets.

Provided is a good base for writing a client/bot framework for Monster & Me 2.5.

This code is presented AS-IS. It may or may not compile. This code was intended for use on GNU/Linux or OS X. I believe I had it running on OS X as well as Ubuntu.

May the force be with you.
